        <p>COUNTRY-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ESG RATINGS<br><br>
            Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI)<br><br>
            The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) is an independent monitoring tool for tracking countries’ climate protection performance. It aims to enhance transparency in international climate politics and enables comparison of climate protection efforts and progress made by individual countries.<br><br>
            On the basis of standardized criteria, the CCPI currently evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 57 countries and of the European Union (EU), which are together responsible for more than 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.<br><br>
            On a national scale (from zero to 100), the CCPI evaluates greenhouse gas emissions, usage of renewable energy resources, energy use per capita, and each country’s climate policy.<br><br>
            The CCPI is compiled for the United Nations by Germanwatch, the NewClimate Institute for Climate Policy and Global Sustainability, and the Climate Action Network.<br>
            Years: 2008-2020, produced annually. Denominated in floats/decimals, ranging from the lowest score of zero to the highest of 100.<br><br>

            Environmental Performance Index (EPI)<br><br>
The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) provides a data-driven summary of the state of sustainability around the world.<br><br>
Using 32 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, the EPI ranks 180 countries on environmental health and ecosystem vitality.<br><br>
These indicators provide a composite gauge at a national scale (from zero to 100) of how close countries are to established environmental policy targets.<br><br>
The EPI offers a scorecard that highlights leaders and laggards in environmental performance and provides practical guidance for countries that aspire to move toward a sustainable future. The metrics on which the rankings are based come from a variety of sources and represent the most recent published data, often from preceding years.<br><br>
The 2020 EPI analysis does not reflect recent developments, including the dramatic drop in air pollution in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic or the greenhouse gas emissions from the extensive Amazonian fires in 2019.<br><br>
The EPI is jointly produced by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), part of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.<br><br>
Years: 2000-2020, produced on a bi-annual basis.  Expressed in floats/decimals, ranging from the lowest score of zero to the highest of 100.<br><br>
